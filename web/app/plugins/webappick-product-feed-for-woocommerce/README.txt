== WHY SHOULD YOU USE THIS WOOCOMMERCE PRODUCT FEED PLUGIN? ==

CTX Feed is the best WooCommerce product feed plugin, and we proclaim it because we are the first pioneering plugin builder when it comes to creating a Product Feed for WooCommerce. We have been in the industry long enough to understand how WooCommerce feed works. Thatâ€™s why we have introduced all the WordPress-Goers with our robust and revolutionary features that could facilitate your product uploading experience and get you rid of any trouble you face, such as uploading rejection or lack of necessary marketing channelsâ€™ attributes or inability to translate into a correct language or currency, etc.

Over the years of experience and expertise, we have curated all the factors that most online vendors face while creating the feed. You may not customize the productâ€™s description or title properly. Also, the image links for the multiple variations of the same products may not function properly. Besides, making the feed in CSV format requires you to enter the data in the spreadsheet, resulting in a massive draining of your energy. If you need to create two feed files using CSV and XML format, the immediate transitions do not happen concurrently.

Here, our CTX Feed â€“ WooCommerce Product Feed Plugin solves all the problems by giving you an ad-hoc solution. You can also format any attributes based on the output type that we have provided. We didnâ€™t create those outputs by accident; we got them created from the feedback you all raised once encountering the issues. Hence, our tailored solutions can solve simple problems like formatting the price listing from two decimal to any decimals while giving the option to apply an integer. At the same time, this user-friendly plugin provides valuable identifiers add-on options to avoid any mismatch between the same brandâ€™s products.

Letâ€™s jump deeper into the ample features this mighty plugin has to offer:

= â˜ž UNLIMITED PRODUCTS =

No matter what the size of your inventory is, you can upload all of your products with no restriction imposed. From hundreds to thousands, you can upload unlimited products of your online store into any of the channels mentioned above, and that too with subtlety.

= â˜ž UNLIMITED FEED =

Like unlimited products uploading, you can make an infinite number of feeds containing any number of products of any sized store. You can access all the product feed files from the Manage Feeds option. To find the right feed out of a massive collection of feeds, you can look at the unique name of the feed instead of looking at the URL for your convenience.

= ðŸ’¯100+ PRE-CONFIGURED TEMPLATES ðŸ’¯ =

With our pre-configured 100+ built-in templates, you can make product feed within minutes without having to take excess pressure in researching every individual attribute or necessary field requirements of the known channels. It is time-consuming and bothersome to some extent. Besides, it is of no guarantee that your gleaned attributes will match precisely with the channelsâ€™ requirement, as some might change or some might turn from optional to compulsory.

Therefore, it is worth playing it safe to take advantage of our ready-made templates crafted extensively for the desired marketplaces.

= â˜ž SUPPORTS ANY PRODUCT FEED FILE TYPE =

This stellar WooCommerce product feed manager create the Product Feed for WooCommerce into 5 different feed file formats, the highest compared to any WooCommerce feed generator out there. The types are;

* **XML** Product Feed
* **CSV** Product Feed
* **TSV** Product Feed
* **XLS** Product Feed
* **TXT** Product Feed
* **JSON** Product Feed

These 5 types ensure that you create a product feed that appears differently yet uniquely to various marketing channels that they are destined to be promoting the products. They contain product information, including title, description, image URL, price, identifiers, and other attributes. Hence their appearance in the feed file entirely depends on how the channel wants to add them based on the type that you have selected. CTX Feed does them automatically once you select the type.

= â˜ž CREATE WOOCOMMERCE PRODUCT FEED USING USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE =

The purpose of creating the feed is to carry out the information & attributes of the products, which the designated channels can upload rightly and aptly. It allows the customers to find your products without missing any crucial information. Likewise, the marketing-based rejection rate drops significantly as the merchant meets all the requirements of that particular channel. The CTX Feed has all the elements rightly aligned on the same page to create or customize the right channels.

You donâ€™t have to create any separate window to find, amend or modify any attributes or mandatory fields as all of them are in the same window. It makes your uploading process way easier without requiring any prior technical knowledge, making it less mistakable as you donâ€™t have to hover in and out of the window too often.

= â˜ž SUPPORTS ANY WOOCOMMERCE PRODUCT TYPES =

We value your concern, and to reduce any unnecessary nuisances of finding the relevant products, CTX Feed enables your WooCommerce feed to fully incorporate by supporting all the plugins that help you provide options for Bundle products, composite products, mix and match products, and finally, subscription product. The reason being CTX Feed the best WooCommerce product feed plugin is because it supports some of the top-notch plugins like the following;

* <a target="_blank" href="https://woocommerce.com/products/composite-products/">WooCommerce Composite Products</a>: This is a kit-builder plugin that is supported by CTX Feed, which allows the customers to customize or tweak their products from all the small accessories found on the product page to enhance the use of that specific product

* <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-composite-products/">WPC Composite Products for WooCommerce</a>

CTX Feed readily endorses all of those plugins to create a Product Feed for WooCommerce in a perfect way.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/">WooCommerce Subscription</a>: If you cover any subscription-based products, it will be easy for you to have a plugin that will give you an estimation of your residual revenue. Whatever money you make from the weekly, monthly, or annual subscription from the recurrent fees can be easily monitored using the WooCommerce Subscription plugin. CTX Feed boosts the outstanding experience by supporting the pertinent plugins needed for this effect to take place.

= â˜ž VARIABLE AND VARIATION FEATURES ALL-INCLUSIVE =

Having multiple variable child products is no longer a hassle; you can now include any variations that a product might possess.

**Bear In Mind** - with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://webappick.com/plugin/woocommerce-product-feed-pro/">CTX Feed Pro</a>  - you get six options where you can decide whether you wish to have all the products along with variations by selecting variable + variations or only variations by choosing all variations. You can also decide if you wish to go for parent product only or just any specific variant. Just set the instruction, and our WooCommerce-WP product feed manager will automatically include or exclude the variable and variations.

= â˜ž CREATING CUSTOM TEMPLATES FOR ANY CHANNELS =

This free version allows you to make any template for your personalized marketplace. If you intend to create a template for a more complex XML feed file, that is possible too. Using Custom Template 2 a premium feature of CTX Feed Pro, the developers can easily play around with the coding system to make any attributes you need for your channels. Also, if you want us to focus on your marketing channels and include its template in our CTX Feed plugin, you are requested to send your feed requirements to the <a target="_blank" href="https://webappick.com/contact/">CTX Feed Support Team</a>.

= â˜ž PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES: =

Attributes are the mainstay of the product feed. The purpose to create a product feed for WooCommerce is to get as much information as possible regarding the inventory products. Based on that, your products will be highlighted on your preferred marketplace.

CTX Feed â€“ a powerful WooCommerce product feed plugin, that helps you create any attributes into any channels alongside the pre-configured attributes. These attributes can range from product ID, Title, Description, Image link, Brand, Price, MPN to Tax, Shipping, Gender, Height, Material, Availability, Stock Availability, Size, Delivery Cost, and many more. You can either avail them directly from the drop-down menu or make your bespoke one.

= â˜ž USE OUTPUT TYPES TO AVOID ANY ERRORS =

Output types are the one that makes this plugin the best plugin to create Product Feed for WooCommerce. When you create a Product Feed for WooCommerce, it is most likely that mistakes continue without your acknowledgment. Remember, not all your merchants require all of the information, such as when it comes to adding HTML tags, manipulation of shortcodes, or wrong exploitation of the numbering format.

To use them correctly in your attributes, the use of correct output is a prerequisite. You have an option to change or apply any output types for any given attributes for any channels. We have over 20 output types, and take a look at how it works;

* **Strip Tags**: If you any HTML code like `<p>string </p>` in any attributes, strip tag will remove it and leave it as only String

* **Remove Special Characters**: Using this, you can get rid of any unnecessary non-UTF-8 characters of product description derived from any source when copied.

* **CDATA**: Your XML feed file will show up as an error if there is a contradiction between the XML element and only element. It generally happens when the words of the XML attributes, such as Title, Description, etc., match exactly with the main words in the description, title, or other attributesâ€™ boxes.
This plugin can remove this issue when applied CDATA as it sets the code into every attribute like the following <g:description> <![CDATA[description]]> </g:description>

* **Remove Shortcodes**: Shortcodes are the small codes that take to you the page where you have added any specific elements, such as slides, images, tables, etc. Having them in the description or title can cause trouble when they are made using different plugins; it can be possible that you no longer have those plugins. Also, you may not want to see an imageâ€™s shortcode in the description when you already have a link to that image.
Therefore, Remove Shortcodes will remove that particular code from those sections, freeing you from any hassles.

* **Price**: Your pricing format is essential, especially if it is still not tweaked. If you use the price format on WooCommerce, which doesnâ€™t fit into the standard format, donâ€™t worry! The CTX Feedâ€™s default pricing mode will apply to your price. Still, you can customize your pricing format using our plugin.
Remove Space: If you accidentally put double space between any words or texts, or characters, you can remove them in any attributes using Remove Space.

* **Parent**: If the product has variations, then the main product is called the variable, and the child products are called the variations. In this instance, if the information like the description of the variable is not empty, then the variable (parent) is given more priority and adds the description of that parent. Whereas the variations (child products) value will be selected when the variable description is empty

* **Parent_if_empty**: It means, when the variations information, such as description, is empty, it will only add the value of the parent (variable)
Google Date Format: You can easily set your date as per Googleâ€™s required Merchant required format like [Date and time, ISO 8601 compliant (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss, or YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss Z)].

= â˜ž PREFIX & SUFFIX: =

Both prefix and suffix are a series of letter, or more precisely, characters that describe the pattern of the Value of the attributes within the Product Feed for WooCommerce. Prefix sits just before the value, whereas the suffix sits after the value. One such example is the currency code, which is an important factor in deciding whether the plugin used to generate it is the best WooCommerce product feed plugin. You can use the currency symbol such as Â£ or $ as a prefix before the amount (the value) or the USD or GBP as a suffix right after the amount.

= â˜ž STATIC VALUE: =

This is one of the most distinctive features that CTX Feed users can take advantage of when dealing with an enormous number of products. You get to choose whether you wish to apply the same value for all the products in the Merchant center or individual value. Attribute and pattern are the two types; the Attribute denotes the individual value for all the products, and the Static implies the same value for all.

For instance, if you have hundreds of products that refer to the same brand, in that case, you will choose a Pattern type that will decide the same value for all of them. However, in the case of a unique identifier like SKU, you will choose the Attribute type as the SKU is unique for each product.

= â˜ž CATEGORY MAPPING: =

Categories are the essential key to get products into search results. It is best practice to assign the most matching shopping engine category to your WooCommerce store category for each product.
